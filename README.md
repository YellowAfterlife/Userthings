# Userthings

A disorganized collection of userstyles and userscripts that I made over the years.

Unless stated otherwise, userstyles are tested with
[Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)
and userscripts are tested with
[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

## "What's with all the light themes?"

I often work in well-lit environments and staring into a little (or not-so-little)
dark rectangle is non-preferable.

For code editors I use light or semi-dark themes (like Tomorrow Night Blue or Zenburn), but the latter do not easily translate to websites, so I stick to light themes.
