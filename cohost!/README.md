## [Collapsible posts](cohost-collapsible-posts.user.js) (js)

![](cohost-collapsible-posts.png)

Have you read this one already? Not too interested in takes on today's website drama? Got tricked into expanding a 10K-pixel-tall post again? Well good news, you can now click on an empty spot in post headers (the yellow-ish area showing author and date) to collapse a post. And if you change your mind, click it again and it'll expand back.

## [Post scroller](cohost-post-scroller.user.js) (js)

Ever wanted to browse cohost, like, really quickly? Or, perhaps, really efficiently?

Scrolling with mouse or arrow keys isn't so fast, and it's hard to keep track of where the posts start and end when using Page Up / Page Down.

So I had this idea for a userscript that makes it so that Home / End let you move between posts, keeping the "current" post at the top of the screen. And if you're reading a Big Post, Page Up / Page Down still work and you can finally press End when you're done with it.

"Zooms" user avatars when you hover your mouse over them.

Pretty sure that I made this after seeing
[this post](https://cohost.org/blep/post/4802529-recently-i-found-o)
from `@blep` and had it lying around ever since.

Works in common spots? (feed, comments, notifications)

Perhaps someone can come up with a better way of doing this effect.
