# TweetDeck things

Ah, \[legacy] TweetDeck. How long until it's completely obliterated in favor of the buggy, laggy new version? Cherish the things while you still have them.

### [Horizontal menu](tweetdeck-horizontal-menu.user.css)

Moves the menu (with Tweet button, search, and your columns) to the top of the page when in collapsed mode.

### [Lightboxes](tweetdeck-lightboxes.user.js) (js)

![](tweetdeck-lightboxes.jpg)

Shows a pannable, zoomable lightbox when clicking on images, GIFs, profile avatars, and profile backgrounds. Can be middle-clicked to invert the image.

### [Bigger modals](tweetdeck-bigger-modals.user.css)

![](tweetdeck-bigger-modals.jpg)
Stretches profile modal windows to be wider and cover window height.

Particularly handy for viewing at >1080p and/or vertical displays.

### [Modal history](tweetdeck-modal-history.user.js) (js)

When navigating to a user profile by clicking a `@handle` in another user's profile modal,
previous location will be displayed on the left of the profile modal (only in summary view).
