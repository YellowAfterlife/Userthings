# IMGXIS

IMGXIS is a small userscript aimed to make the image viewing experiences
in Firefox and Chromium based browsers much more pleasant.

It introduces panning, zooming, and the ability to preview the image against the different backgrounds.
It also enables "pixelated" rendering for images, meaning that you will be able to preview small pixelart much easier.

Works in GreaseMonkey (Firefox) and TamperMonkey (Firefox, Chromium).

Usage is straightforward - the userscript will automatically add in the controls whenever an image is opened via a direct link. Click & drag to pan around, mouse wheel to zoom towards/from the mouse point, click color buttons to change the page background, shift+click them to open color adjustment menu.
